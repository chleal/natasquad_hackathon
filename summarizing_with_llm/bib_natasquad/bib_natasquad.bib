	abstract = {In the past years, traditional pattern recognition methods have made great progress. However, these methods rely heavily on manual feature extraction, which may hinder the generalization model performance. With the increasing popularity and success of deep learning methods, using these techniques to recognize human actions in mobile and wearable computing scenarios has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, a deep neural network that combines convolutional layers with long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed. This model could extract activity features automatically and classify them with a few model parameters. LSTM is a variant of the recurrent neural network (RNN), which is more suitable for processing temporal sequences. In the proposed architecture, the raw data collected by mobile sensors was fed into a two-layer LSTM followed by convolutional layers. In addition, a global average pooling layer (GAP) was applied to replace the fully connected layer after convolution for reducing model parameters. Moreover, a batch normalization layer (BN) was added after the GAP layer to speed up the convergence, and obvious results were achieved. The model performance was evaluated on three public datasets (UCI, WISDM, and OPPORTUNITY). Finally, the overall accuracy of the model in the UCI-HAR dataset is 95.78\%, in the WISDM dataset is 95.85\%, and in the OPPORTUNITY dataset is 92.63\%. The results show that the proposed model has higher robustness and better activity detection capability than some of the reported results. It can not only adaptively extract activity features, but also has fewer parameters and higher accuracy.},

	abstract = {Fast, accurate and robust fault diagnosis is an indispensable part of condition-based maintenance (CBM) and intelligent methods are widely used for this purpose. However, the intelligent methods with satisfied diagnosis accuracy are always accompanied by high computing cost, which limits their application in the industrial applications with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a fast accurate and robust rotating machinery diagnosis method based on one-dimensional(1-D) convolutional neural network, which works directly on the raw signal without any preprocessing. Besides, the proposed method uses single full-connected layer for reducing computing cost. The experimental results obtained using bearing and gearbox dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can realize fast, accurate and robust fault diagnosis, which is suitable for real-time diagnosis applications.},
